  First, analyze the package URL to determine the package type, then provide targeted recovery:
  
  1. **Package Type Detection from URL**:
     - Analyze the URL to determine if it's Python, R, or other
     - Look for domain indicators: pypi.org (Python), cran.r-project.org (R), bioconductor.org (R)
     - For GitHub repositories, analyze repository language, README content, file structure
     - For other URLs, look for language-specific file patterns
  
  2. **Analyze Creation Failure**:
     - Review the error message and identify the root cause
     - Determine which creation method failed
     - Identify specific issues with the creation process
  
  3. **Provide Type-Specific Alternative Methods**:
     - For Python packages:
       * Manual PyPI recipe creation: `spack create --skip-editor py-{{ package_name }}`
       * Use existing Python package as template
       * Check PyPI for package info and metadata
     - For R packages:
       * Manual CRAN recipe creation: `spack create --skip-editor r-{{ package_name }}`
       * Use existing R package as template
       * Check CRAN/Bioconductor for package info
     - For other packages:
       * Manual recipe creation: `spack create --skip-editor {{ package_name }}`
       * Use existing package as template
       * Analyze repository structure and build system
  
  4. **Manual Creation Steps**:
     - Create recipe directory: `mkdir -p packages/{{ recipe_name }}`
     - Create basic package.py with appropriate class
     - Add minimal metadata and version information
     - Research package information from the URL
  
  5. **Existing Examples**:
     - Point to relevant existing recipe examples based on detected type
     - Python examples: py-agate, py-numpy
     - R examples: r-archr, r-plotlistr
     - Other examples: samtools, cmake
  
  6. **Next Actions**:
     - Research the package thoroughly using the URL
     - Create recipe manually using provided guidance
     - Test incrementally starting with basic recipe
     - Seek help if needed
  
  Provide a comprehensive failure analysis including:
  - Detected package type
  - Root cause analysis
  - Type-specific alternative methods
  - Manual creation guidance
  - Relevant examples
  - Recovery recommendations
